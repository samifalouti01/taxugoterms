    <h1>Sadakat — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div>Effective date: August 11, 2025</div>

  <section>
    <p>Sadakat ("we", "our", or "the App") is a donation and community app for mosque donations, blood requests, and public posts. This Privacy Policy explains what (if any) personal data we request or handle, why we request permissions, and how we protect your privacy.</p>

    <h2>Summary — short and clear</h2>
    <p class="note">
      Sadakat <strong>does not store personal data or location data</strong> on our servers. The app only requests location permission to show nearby mosques on the map while you are using the map. When you return from the map view, your location is not saved or retained by the app.
    </p>

    <h2>What information the app accesses</h2>
    <p><strong>Location permission:</strong> When you open the Map feature to find nearby mosques, Sadakat requests access to your device's location (precise or approximate, depending on your device settings). This permission is used <em>only</em> to show the mosques closest to you in real time while the map is open.</p>

    <p><strong>Other data:</strong> Sadakat does not require sign-in, and the app does not collect or store personal identifiers, contact lists, messages, or any other personal data on our servers. Public posts and donation actions occur in the app but are not stored by Sadakat (confirm your backend or third-party services if you later connect any server storage).</p>

    <h2>How we use location data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We use your device location only to compute &nbsp;nearby mosques while you are actively using the map feature.</li>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> transmit or save that location to our servers after you leave the map view.</li>
      <li>We do not build user profiles, track movement over time, or sell/ share location data to third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions & your control</h2>
    <p>You remain in control of location permission. You can grant or revoke location access via your device settings. If you decline permission, the map will not be able to show mosques based on your current location, but other parts of the app will continue to work.</p>

    <h2>Retention and storage</h2>
    <p>Sadakat does not store location or personal data on our servers. If you connect the app to any third-party service (for example, to process donations or post content), that is outside the scope of this policy — check the third party's privacy policy for their data practices.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable technical measures to protect any minimal app data and prevent unauthorized access. Because Sadakat does not store personal/location data on our servers, risks tied to server-side retention are intentionally minimized.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect or store personal data from children. If you are a parent and believe your child has provided personal data to the App, contact us (see below).</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. When we update, we will revise the "Effective date" at the top. You should check this page periodically.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or requests about this policy (for example, to request deletion of any data you believe we hold), please contact us at: <strong><a href="mailto:samifalouti02@gmail.com">samifalouti02@gmail.com</a></strong>.</p>
